# Leader Board Bootstrap


This responsive website's layout will fit extra large, large, small, and extra small devices' screens. I have made this website responsible by using Bootstrap. I have also used HTML5 to build the structure of the website.

To build the whole website, I have customize many Bootstrap classes according to the design. This was the big challenge for me. In contrast, Bootstrap gave me some classes that has allowed me to create different sections of the website so easily
